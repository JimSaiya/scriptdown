# Ignore everything in this directory
*
# Except this file
!.gitignore
#
# Doing this allows me to commit this directory to the git repo, with its
# flags to not be shown. This way, the directory won't get in people's way
# and everything inside of it still gets ignored (because its managed locally
# by npm)
