## INT. DUNPHY HOUSE - Phil & Claire's Room - 8:00 AM
### Phil lies in bed staring at his alarm clock. It goes off, and Phil is quick to dismiss it. He pulls back the covers, revealing that he was sleeping fully dressed while spooning a duffel bag. Phil darts out of bed and excitedly runs out into the hallway, duffel bag in hands. Close up on Claire, who's eyes are closed but shoot open as she darts out of bed as soon as Phil leaves the room.

## INT. Dunphy House - Luke's Room
### Cut to a similar shot of Luke, except his alarm is going off and he is not waking up. Suddenly, Phil bursts through the door, excitedly waking Luke up as he drops the duffel bag on the floor and sits on the foot of the bed.

> Phil
Get up buddy. It's Dude Day!!

> Luke

Ugh, Dad, its so early. Can't we sleep in just a little longer?

> Phil
	looking hurt
What? But you love this day.

### Luke reluctantly begins to get up, it is obvious that he's doing it for his Dad's sake.

> Luke
OK, I'm up.

## PHIL Interview
### Phil is holding up his iPad displaying the screen to the camera. He is holding it like one would hold a children's book to an audience. Phil is reading the following story as though it is a children's bookâ€“one he created using the app on his iPad. The first illustration shows a stick figure-its Phil.

> PHIL
Once upon a time, there was a man named Phil.

### Phil swipes to the next page: an illustrated family portrait of Phil, Claire, Alex, and Haley.

> PHIL..
Phil had a wife and two lovely daughters who he loved very much.
### Phil swipes to the next page: a picture of a stick figure holding a football, but looking lonely, while the other three are painting their nails.
